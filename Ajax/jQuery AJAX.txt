issue with traditional web programing:

* Postback 

If you submit the form, the whole form data  will be sent to the server and the server does some process , then it will reload the whole page with new content.

I don't want postback.

Instead, we just need to submit only the respective form content to the server, then get some dynamic data fromm serrver and update the page partially. 

we should not reload whole page. 

we need partial postbacks.


how to do that? 

	* Don't use submit button.(dont' submiit the form directly.)
	*instead, you can use javascript to read the form data and then submit form data using javascript.




To do partial postbacks , we can use AJAX.

================

Front -End (UI)
	HTML Page
	styles (css)
	javascript(dom manipulation)



Somebody created some server side program:
	asp.net(.aspx)
	jsp page(.jsp)
	servlet
	spring mvc service
	Web service
	RESTful service

Here, we develop some service and configure some endpoint(uri) to that service.

Once it is configured with some endpont and hosted in the web server, the front end developer consume from the UI applicaiton.

we can configure the services with many end points ,each with differeent method.

e.g	
	get
	post
	delete
	put
	

e.g.
	http get:
	
		http://www.demoservice.com/posts

	If you make request to this service, you get some data(raw data)
	The data can be in either in XML or JSON format.





Server Side (Back-end Program)



Note:
	as a UI developer ,we make use of AJAX to make calls to service(RESTful service).
	get some data, and show on the UI.


e.g.
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

================

JSON.parse()  : JSON to JavaScript Object
JSON.stringify() : JavaScript object to JSON

==========
Let us create Single Page Application using jQuery and AJAX
