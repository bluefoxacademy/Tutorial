Angular app:

steps:

* Download angularjs library/framework

* Create  new angular project

* Create Angular project structure

* Create Index (shell page) & design the layout

* Create a module (angular) 

* Configure the App(shell page) with angular application using angular diretive(ng-app)

* Then, you add controllers, directives, factories, services, filters, routes...

* Then, you can configure the templates with controllers and use data binding.

Builtin directives:

ngApp (ng-app)  : To start up the angular application.
ng-if : Add/remove the element/component based on condition.
ng-show : display the element based on the condition (The element will be there in the page)
ng-hide : hides the element based on the condition. (the element will be there in the page)
ng-init : This is for inititializing scope.
ng-repeat : this is for iteration 
ng-bind : one -way binding.
ng-model : two-way binding.
ng-placeholder : html 5 placeholder.
ng-class : adding css class based on condition.
ng-attr  : updating attribute.
ng-required
ng-pattern
ng-value
..



ng-model:
	we use for forms (add new/edit)

form fields :
	textbox
	radiobutton
	checkbox
	textarea
	dropdown
	file upload


angular exp:
	{{property}}



directives:
	ng-model
	data-ng-model ( HTML 5 standard)

	If you validate the page against html 5 validator, then you must use "data-ng-*")

==================

how to create context model without using $scope?


You can use "this" pointer to create context for controller.
