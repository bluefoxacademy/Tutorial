today let us talk about Node.js:

front end applications:

	* Designing the UI for web apps
	* Designing the RWD for web apps
	* Client side scripting for web apps 
	* Single Page Applications
	* MVC for JavaScript (client side script)
	* AngularJS for Single Page Application


from where data is coming? 
To where data is going? 

We used localStorage for data store...



In the real apps, we can make use of some database(SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDb,...)


How to connect to database and get/post data to the database? 

For this , we can use of Server Side programinng.

	e.g.
		PHP
		.NET
		Java
		Ruby
		..
		..

	These are not javascript coding..



I want the same javascript for server side programing...

We need the same javascript for UI and server side programing..


how do it? 

We can use Node.JS for server side programing using JavaScript.

=================================


Node.JS 
	: Platform for server side programing.
		JavaScript is used in Node.JS for progrmaing.


AngularJS  vs Node.js
	
	AngularJS is Javascript MVC framework for Singe Page app(UI)


	Node.JS is a platform where where we do server side programming using javascript.


You can make use of both : (Angular & Node.js) for complete web applications.

LAMP
	Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

MEAN Stack 
	MongoDb
	Express(Node.JS)
	Angular (SPA)
	Node.JS( Server side programing platform for JavaScript)

========================================
IIS
Apache 


Serialization
	Convert from JavaScript object to JSON string
	JSON.stringify()



De-Serialization 
	Convert from JSON string to JavaScript object.
	JSON.parse()


Client <===>Server

Client will submit the data (serilized data)=> The server can read that JSON data and deserialize back to object for additional manipuluation and send some response to client in JSON format(serialized data.

client will receive serialized data from server and can deserializee and then present on the UI.
