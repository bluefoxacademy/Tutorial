Silverlight 

WPF 
	It is for Windows applications 
	It is based on XAML 
	It separates the UI and code file 
		.xaml & .cs 
	It supports 2D direct support
	It supports 3D direct support 
	It supports animation 
	It supports mulitimedia 
	It supports styles (local Resources ,global resources)
	Databinding in WPF is simple compare to regular windows forms 

Note:
	WPF is only for windows with all the above features.

We need to implement all these features web applications(web pages)
	.html
	.asp
	.aspx
	.php
	.jsp
	any page (adode flash)


For this purpose, we got a microsoft product : Silverlight 

Silverlight is an extenion of WPF 
Using Silverlight ,we can create user controls with all the WPF featues . 

Then, we can embed that silverlight user control in any web page.

In the web page, we don't need .net compiler for execution for silivelight component. 

We just need light weight sliverlight plugin.

We use mostly for banners,media elements and animated headers in the web page using silverlight.


Out of Browser option is there in silverlight.
Using this ooption, we can run silverlight component as part of page Or we can run as normal window form executable.

===============
for ajax controls ,we have ajax toolkit.


teleric 
	Third party controls for asp.net 
	This is the 3rd party toolkit for builtin controls for asp.net
e.g.
	charts
	tabs
	geolocation related controls

any body mentioned in the proejcts?
=============
cookies in javascript:
	we can store some data and send that data to the server to identify the client.

If you cookies, for every round trip the cookie will be send to the serrver.

localStorage

sessionStorage

We use both for storing some data in the client machine.
We can re-use that data in all the pages in the web site.




Local storage data persists forever but session storage is valid until the browser is open, as soon as the browser closes the session variable resets.

localStorage is for all the users. 

sessionStorage is for only current user.
